      <h4>
        View-&gt;Fit <a name="view_fit"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Zooms the display to fit the currently displayed cell's bounding box.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Fit+<a name="view_fitplus"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Zooms to 10% bigger than the displayed cell's bounding box.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Zoom In <a name="view_zoomin"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Zooms in on the current cell by 
        a factor of two. You can also zoom in by rotating the mouse wheel forward, 
        or by pressing the right mouse button and dragging an area from lower left 
        to upper right you want to zoom in to.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Zoom Out <a name="view_zoomout"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Zooms out on the current cell by 
        a factor of two. You can also zoom out by rotating the mouse wheel backwards, 
        or by pressing the right mouse button and dragging an area from upper right 
        to lower left. The zoom factor is the current screen size divided by the drag 
        rectangle size.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Zoom Selected<a name="view_zoomselected"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Zooms to fit the window around the selected set.
      </p>

      <h4 align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        View-&gt;Pan <a name="view_pan"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Moves the centre of the display 
        to the entered point. Note that panning can also be achieved by dragging with 
        the middle mouse button held down; the pan is done in real time.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Pan  to Point <a name="view_pantopoint"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Brings up a dialog box in which 
        the X and Y coordinates to pan to can be entered. The display is then centered 
        on these coordinates.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Redraw <a name="view_redraw"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Redraws the screen. The display 
        in Glade is double buffered, so redrawing consists of copying the back buffer 
        to the front. This is fast, and in the OpenGL version of Glade is done using 
        texture mapping which is accelerated by hardware when using modern graphics 
        cards.. If however the display changes (e.g. by changing the layers that are 
        visible in the LSW) then the back buffer has to be drawn again. However, this 
        is still pretty fast.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Ruler
      </h4>

      <p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/createRuler.png"></p>

      <p>
        Draws a ruler. Manhattan, 45 degree and all angle rulers 
        are supported. The popup dialog (toggle using F3 bindkey) allows the ruler 
        <em>snap angle</em> to be changed while entering the ruler. Checking the 
        <em>Invert text labelling</em> box puts the major/minor ticks on the opposite 
        side of the ruler to normal. This can be useful when measuring edges of 
        shapes with dense fills where the ruler text is not easily visible. To more accurately 
        measure distances between shapes, you can turn <a href="#gravity">gravity</a> 
        on, then the start and end points of the ruler can snap to the shape edges. 
        You can zoom and pan while drawing rulers.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Delete Rulers<a name="view_delete_rulers"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Deletes all rulers in the cellview.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;View level 0 <a name="view_view0"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Sets the display levels to 0. No contents of cells are visible.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;View level 99<a name="view_view99"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Sets the display levels to 99. 
        Cells up to 99 levels of hierarchy will have their contents displayed.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Previous View<a name="view_previous"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Sets the viewport to the last view before a pan/zoom/fit etc.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Cancel Redraw <a name="view_cancel"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Cancels the current redraw. This can be useful on very large designs.
      </p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Display Options<a name="display_preferences"></a><a name="view_displayopts"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        Brings up the Display Preferences dialog.
      </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/displayPrefs1.png" width="501" height="468" alt="Display Options1"></p>

      <p>
        <em>Show Axes</em> shows the X=0 and Y=0 axes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Show Labels</em> toggles the 
        display of text labels. By default, text label display is turned off as in 
        non-OpenGL display mode, drawing text labels can be slow if there are many 
        labels.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Show Tracks</em> displays the track grid for each layer for DEF based designs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Display Path Centreline</em> shows the centreline of path objects<em>. 
          Display Path Outline</em> draws the outline of the path, based on its real width<em>.</em>   
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Display Origins - Labels</em> shows the origin of text labels as a small cross<em>. 
        Display Origins - Instances </em>  shows the origin of instances as a small cross. Note 
        that instance origins are only displayed if their bounding box is shown, i.e. they are at the display 
        stop level.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Show Instance Names</em> can be set to <em>None, Master 
        </em>or<em> Instance.</em> With Master, the instance's master cell 
        name is shown inside the instance bounding box. With Instance, the instance 
        name is shown inside the instance bounding box.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Show Via Instance Names</em> can be set to <em>None</em> or <em>Master</em>. 
        This toggles the display of the via instance master.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Label Display</em> allows finer control of 
        text labels. <em>Display Rotated Labels</em> if checked displays text rotated as 
        per its database orientation e.g. from GDS2. When unchecked, labels are 
        displayed with no rotation (horizontally). <em>Display top level labels</em> only if 
        checked will only display labels at the top of the cell hierarchy. Labels 
        contained in lower levels will not be shown.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Label display scale factor</em>  will scale the displayed labels according to the scale 
      factor set. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Transparent</em> controls group selection. When checked, group members are selectable 
        (and the group bounding box shape is not). When unchecked, group members are unselectable, 
        but the group bounding box is. In non-transparent mode groups can be moved, copied, rotated 
        etc. using the group layer shape.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/displayPrefs2.png" width="501" height="468" alt="Display Options2"></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
          <i>Display Levels</i> sets the levels 
        of hierarchy that are displayed. A display level of 0, for example, means only 
        display shapes and instance bounding boxes in the current cell. Although the 
        view level 99 command turns on viewing of 99 levels of hierarchy, there's really 
        no limit.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Filter</i> controls filtering 
        of objects to speed redraw. When zoomed out, it makes no sense drawing objects 
        that are so small that they contribute nothing to the visible display. So 
        with filtering enabled, objects with a size smaller than the threshold (in 
        pixels) are not drawn. Turning filtering off is the same as setting the threshold 
        to 0. Note that path outlines are also subject to filtering; if the path width 
        is less than the threshold then only the path centerline is drawn. Filtering 
        can have a vast effect on redraw speed on large designs! The default filter 
        level is 5 which is a good compromise of detail versus performance. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <i>Display Grid </i> controls the display grid which 
        can be one of None, Dotted or Line.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Display Grid Settings</em>. The Minor X and Y values set the   
        dot or line spacing and are drawn using 
        the 'mingrid' layer. The Major grid spacing is the number of minor grids per 
        major grid dot or line; it should be an integer, typically 5 or 10. The 
        major grid is drawn using the 'majgrid' layer.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/displayPrefs3.png" width="501" height="468" alt="Display Options3"></p>

      <p>
        <i>Snap Grid</i> controls cursor 
        snapping. The cursor is snapped to the values specified in X and Y. Snapping 
        is modified by gravity; see the Selection Options dialog.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Snap Angle</i> controls the 
        angle that data can be entered for some shape creation and also for rulers. 
        <i>Any</i> allows all angles; <i>45 degrees</i> and <i>90 degrees</i> snap 
        accordingly.
      </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/displayPrefs4.png" width="501" height="468" alt="Display Options4"></p>

      <p>
        <em>Infix Mode</em> is used for commands which can take the current mouse position 
        rather than relying on the user to click on the first point of the command.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        <em>Repeat commands</em> will keep repeating a command until the ESC key is pressed.
      </p>            
    
      <p>
        <i>Display coordinates in database 
        units</i> shows coordinates in DB units, rather than microns. This can be 
        useful when working with e.g. DEF files where the ascii coordinates in the 
        file are in DB units.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Always popup option dialogs</em> 
        when checked will always show option dialogs for dialogs such as Create Path. 
        These option dialogs can be shown and hidden by toggling the F3 key. If <i>Always 
        popup option dialogs</i> is not checked, 
        then the option forms will not be shown automatically (but can still be shown by 
        pressing F3). This is useful when entering e.g. a lot of polygons.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Immediate  move/stretch of selected objects</em> will let selected objects be 
        moved by the  cursor without issuing a move/select command. The cursor changes 
        according to  the object. To use, select an object in full mode, or an edge/vertex 
        in partial  mode. The cursor will change to a 4-way arrow (for full mode select) or 
        a 2-way  arrow (for partial mode select). Then left click and drag to move or stretch  
        the object. The object is deselected afterwards (unless <em>Keep immediate move selected</em> 
        is checked), so to repeat the command,  select another object.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Keep immediate move  selected</em> will keep objects selected after an immediate 
        move/stretch; otherwise  all objects will be deselected.  
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Zoom centred on cursor </em>will zoom around the cursor, rather than zooming the viewport.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Auto focus</em> sets 
        input focus to the canvas whenever the mouse moves over it. If this option is 
        unchecked, then the user has to explicitly click on the main window in order to 
        e.g. use bindkeys after any operation that transfers focus to another window. 
        Some Window managers may override this operation because they provide control of 
        focus directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Auto raise</em> raises 
        the canvas window the mouse is over automatically. If this option is not set, 
        the canvas must be explicitly clicked on to make it the active window for 
        accelerator key input.</font>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Use True Layout Colour</em> will use the layer colour/fill for drawing during Create/Move
        /Copy/Stretch commands, rather than a hollow fill in the cursor layer colour.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Draw Moving Inst Contents</em> draws the contents of instances and vias while creating, 
        moving or opying them. The contents are either shown with a hollow line fill in the cursor 
        colour if <em>Use true layer colour</em> is not checked, or using the real layer colour and 
        fill style if that option is checked.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Use Design Rule Halo</em> will perform realtime DRC and highlight shapes that would give 
        rise to DRC MINSPACE violations. The violating shapes have a halo drawn round them which is 
        the MINSPACE distance away from their edges/vertices. Checking is done for shapes (not yet 
        instances) that are created/moved/copied/stretched, against existing shapes either at the 
        top level of the hierarchy or also lower levels. Hierarchy check depth is controlled by the 
        display stop level, i.e. checking will be performed to the depth of hierarchy that is displayed. 
        <em>DRD options</em> controls which rules are checked; <em>Width</em> if checked turns on width 
        checking of shapes, using the MINWIDTH rule for the layer, <em>Two layer spacing</em> turns 
        on spacing checks between two different layers, using two layer MINSPACE rules. <em>Enclosure</em> 
        and <em>Extension</em> enable checking minimum enclosure/minimum extension rules using the 
        techfile MINENC / MINEXT rules.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Halo Colour</em> is the layer colour used to draw the DRC violation halo. 
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>RMB mode</em> sets the 
        operation of the right mouse button. It can be set to <em>Glade</em> mode 
        (dragging the mouse down zooms in, dragging it up zooms out), <em>Virtuoso</em> 
        mode (dragging the right mouse in any direction zooms in) or <em>Special</em> 
        mode (dragging the right mouse down zooms in, dragging it up left zooms out, 
        dragging it up right does a window fit).
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>
        View-&gt;Selection  Options<a name="selection_options"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>  
        Displays the Selection Options form.
      </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/selOptions.png" width="341" height="453" alt="Selection"></p>

      <p>
        <i>Selection Mode</i>  is set to Full or Partial. Bindkey F4 toggles between these modes. 
        <i>Full </i>mode selects the entire object.&nbsp;Partial mode selects an edge or vertex of 
        an object.&nbsp;Use&nbsp;Partial 
        mode to select edges or vertices for subsequent stretch commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Selection Type</i> can be either&nbsp; 
        <i>object</i> mode or <i>net</i> mode. In&nbsp; <i>object</i> mode, only the object 
        selected becomes part of the selected set. In <i>net</i> mode, if a selected 
        object is part of a net then all shapes that are part of that net are selected.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a name="show_connectivity"></a>Show 
        connectivity</i> displays flightlines between instance pins that have connectivity. 
        <i>Max pins</i> sets the limit to the number of pins that a connectivity flightline 
        is drawn. <em>Show Inst Pins</em> shows instance pins as well as nets when <em>Show Connectivity</em> 
        or <em>Show selected connectivity</em> is checked. <em>Show selected connectivity</em> 
        shows connectivity flightlines when an object is selected that has net connectivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dim unselected objects</i> will 
        dim all unselected objects if any object(s) are selected. Unselected objects 
        will be dimmed according to the <i>Dim factor</i> specified. This 
        is useful when selecting an object e.g. a net by name in a large design and you 
        want to display 
        the selected object clearly. Dim unhilited objects will dim all unhighlighted objects, if highlighting is used 
        e.g. by the Trace Net command.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Limit instPin query for net</i> 
        will limit the number of instance pins shown in the Query Net dialog. This 
        is useful when querying power/ground nets which may have hundreds of thousands 
        of special net pins. Such a number of pins means the dialog is slow to build. 
        Regular net pins are always shown.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i><a name="gravity"></a>Gravity</i> 
        when enabled will snap the cursor box to the nearest shape edge or vertex. 
        The <i>Range</i> field determines how far an object edge can be from the current 
        cursor position for gravity to take effect. Gravity works for all shapes and 
        also the bounding boxes of instances at the current level of hierarchy only. 
        <i>Depth</i> sets how far down the physical hierarchy shapes will be snapped 
        to; for example with depth=0 only shapes in the current cell will be snapped 
        to. Note that the grid snapping as set in the <a href="#display_preferences">display 
        options dialog</a> overrides gravity snapping: in other words gravity snapping 
        will snap to the nearest coordinate on grid if an object's edge is not on 
        grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Gravity snap to</i> sets whether 
        snapping to edges or vertices is carried out when gravity is on.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Gravity to Path</i> sets whether 
        gravity snaps to path centrelines or edges.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Display Cursor Box</i> shows 
        a small square box in the LSW cursor colour, centered on the cursor, which 
        is snapped to the current snap grid, or snapped to the nearest edge within 
        gravity distance if gravity is on.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Cross Cursor</i> when checked 
        will display the cursor as a crosshair rather than as a box.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Dynamic Highlight</i> 
        highlights the object that will be selected if the left mouse button is clicked 
        in Full selection mode. In Edge selection mode it highlights selectable edges, 
        and in Vertex selection mode it highlights selectable vertices.
      </p>

      </h4>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/panZoomOptions.png" width="301" height="195" alt="PanZoom"></p>

      <p>
        Displays the pan / zoom options 
        dialog. <i>Zoom in %</i> sets the percentage that a zoom in changes the current 
        magnification. For example 200% zooms in by a factor of two. <i>Zoom out %</i> 
        sets the percentage that a zoom out changes the current magnification. For 
        example 50% zooms out by a factor of two. <i>Pan %</i> sets the percentage 
        of screen width that is panned by the pan keys (left/right/up/down keys). 
        For example 50% means shift the viewport half of the current viewport width. 
        <i>Fit %</i> sets the percentage of screen width occupied by the current cellview's 
        bounding box when a Fit command is issued. It can be in the range 10%-100%.
