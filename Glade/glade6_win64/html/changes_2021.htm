      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Version 5.0.13 / 4.7.52 release on 01/01/2021</strong></p>
      <p align="left">- Update net browser after Edit-&gt;setNet cmd</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: save changes to SDL map list after editing.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: schematic autorouter now routes correctly to
        offgrid locations.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Single segment rulers were not commited on 2nd
        click/return.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Clearing hilights caused possible memory
        corruption issue.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Version 5.0.14 / 4.7.53 release on 18/01/2021</strong></p>
      <p align="left">- Properties internal cleanup. Class 'proplist' renamed
        'properties'. Class pListItem has private members and accessor
        functions. orient_t type property removed (it was only used for DEF
        ROWs, and an integer prop type used in replacement).</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: stretch wire could remove extra vertices.</p>
      <p align="left">- Callbacks implemented for properties.
        dbSetPropCallback() and dbGetPropCallback() functions added. A Python
        callback function registered to a property will be called when that
        property is changed, e.g. in the query dialog of the Create Instance
        dialog. This allows automatic updating e.g. changing the 'fins' property
        on a mos device could alter the 'w' property via a callback.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left">To add a callback: Use the Query dialog to display
          properties e.g of a symbol. Enter the name of the callback function in
          the callback field. Only the function name is required. A python file
          must exist in the paython path with the same name as the callback, and
          extension .py (much the same as for PCells). The python function
          should have a single argument, 'pyDBObject', which is the dbObj which
          called the callback. See for example the FreePDK15 example PDK.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">- Initial version of simulation environment. The current
        supported simulator is Xyce from Sandia Labs (https://xyce.sandia.gov/).
        And example PDK (XyceLib) is supplied with the Glade distribution.</p>
      <p align="left">- Library rebinding did not rebind some unbound instances.
        This has been fixed.</p>
      <p align="left">- Stipple patterns were incorrectly copied in certain
        cases from the techfile.</p>

      <p align="left">- Internal memory manager improvements.</p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: various memory leaks cleaned up. This is
        only likely to affect Glade API users.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Version 5.0.16/ 4.7.55 release on 23/01/2021</strong></p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: Via contents can now be shown, like
        instances, when creating or moving vias if the 'Draw Moving Instance
        Contents' option is on (Display Options Misc dialog). </p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: Runlength dependent spacing rule:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>geomSpace(layer, rule, runlength, flags, msg) </p>
        <p>Checks the spacing of projecting edges of layer is not less than <em>rule</em>
          (microns). <br>
          The length of projecting edges is specified by <em>runlength</em>
          (microns), and <em>flags</em> modifier for runlength can be lessthan,
          greaterthan, equals, not_equals, as well as horizontal, vertical,
          diagonal.</p>
      </blockquote>

        have now been made case insensitive.</p>
      <p align="left">-enhancement: added ui::booleanOp() for layer based
        booleans via Python without using geom... commands. This is compatible
        with C++ API.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

        Ruler cmd the cursor will highlight edges/centrelines/vertices to snap
        the start and the stop of the ruler to.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Stretching a HSeg edge caused a crash.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: HSeg/VSeg centreline drawn incorrectly when

      <p align="left">- enhancement: Supports spice3f5 simulator</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash if a plot expression was deleted
        from the plot window and then added again.</p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: DC Operating point analysis added to
        simulation menu. If the 'Backannotate to schematic' option is chosen,
        then net voltages will be backannotated to the schematic as a property
        on wires called 'voltage'. With highlighting on, tooltips will be shown
        for wires that have the net property set.</p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: extractMOS() and extractMOSDevice() now
        extract BSIM instance parameters SA, SB, (distance from diffusion edge
        to gate) and SC (distance of well edge to gate) allowing more accurate
        simulation of layout dependent effects (LDE).</p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic wiring improvement with better
        snapping to offgrid pin centres.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Removal of colinear start/end points of
        Schematic wires improved.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">- bugfix: geomLength() was not working correctly.</p>
      <p align="left">- enhancement: Preliminary release of the layout point to point interactive router. This is a grid based router useful for LEF/DEF designs and it requires the routing grid to be defined (although will fall back to the layout X and Y snap grid if the grid is not defined). It is an option to the Create Path command with the same mode of operation. When starting or finishinga path it will snap to pin shape centres if within the routing grid. The 'U' (layer up) and 'D' (layer down) bindkeys work as before to drop a via and change layer to the above/below routing layer. Layers on type BLOCKAGE and other net/pin shapes not on the same net form obstructions for the router.</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="left">- bugfix: Edit-&gt;Rotate did not undo correctly.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Edit-&gt;Rotate dialog has OK button removed as it did not perform any useful action - the icon buttons do all the work.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: Create Path could delete a path point since 5.0.36</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Version 5.0.39 release on 03/12/2021</strong></p>

      <p align="left">- bugfix: Stopped setting stipple dialog from displaying query dialog.</p>
      <p align="left">- bugfix: cdb::library::dbSaveLib() could create spurious directories if relative paths were given.</p>
