  <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Create Commands</font></h2>

  <p>
    Create commands for shapes (text, 
    paths, polygons and rectangles) all work on the current layer as set in the 
    <a href="theLSW.htm">LSW</a> by left mouse clicking on the layer box. All 
    the create commands pop up a dialog box which can be shown or hidden by pressing 
    the F3 bindkey. Create commands can be terminated by hitting the Escape bindkey. 
    Zooming and panning is possible during Create commands.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="images/createCircle.png" width="288" height="139" alt="Create Circle">
  </p>

  <p>
    Creates a circle in the current cell on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current layer</a>. 
    Circles are entered using two left mouse clicks, or a single click if<a href="view_menu.htm#infix_mode"> 
    Infix mode</a> is set. The first point (or the current cursor position if 
    Infix mode is set) defines the centre of the circle, and the second point 
    is a point on the circumference of the circle. <i>Radius snap grid</i> is 
    the snap grid (usually the manufacturing grid) to snap the circle's radius 
    to. <i>Number of segments</i> is the number of line segments used to represent 
    the circle on export to GDS2 or OASIS.

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Inst...<a name="create_inst"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/createInst.png" width="321" height="352" alt="Create Instance"></p>

  <p>
    Creates an instance or array in the current cell. An instance is entered using a single 
    left mouse click,  which defines the origin of the instance. The instance master cell can be  
    chosen from those present in the library using the <em>cellName</em> combo box and the <em>viewName</em> 
    combo box. The instance's <em>InstName</em> is  auto generated but can be changed by the user 
    if required in the <em>instName</em> field. <em>Orientation</em> can be one of 
    R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MXR90, MY,  MYR90. Arrays of instances can be generated if <em>Num Rows</em> 
    and/or <em>Num Cols</em> is not 1; the spacing between rows and columns is set by <em>Row Spacing</em> 
    and <em>Column  Spacing</em>, unless <em>Set Row/Col spacing  interactively</em> is checked. In that 
    case, if <em>Num Rows</em> is greater than 1, the user is prompted for the location  of the first 
    instance of the second row (setting the rowSpacing), and if <em>Num Cols</em> is greater than 1, 
    the user is  prompted for the location of the first instance of the second column (setting  the colSpacing). 
    The instance bounding box is displayed during the command to  assist in placement of the instance. 
    <em>Rotate</em> (or the bindkey &lsquo;r&rsquo; during instance placement) rotates the instance counter  
    clockwise. <em>Mirror Y</em> (or the &lsquo;y&rsquo;  bindkey during instance placement) mirrors the 
    instance about the Y axis. <em>Mirror X</em> (or the &lsquo;x&rsquo; bindkey during  instance placement) 
    mirrors the instance about the X axis.
  </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/createInst2.png" width="431" height="376" alt="Create Inst Props"></p>

  <p>
    The <i>Instance Properties</i> tab can be used to set properties on the instance, e.g. if 
    the master cell is a <a href="pcells.htm">pcell</a> or a symbol. The '+' button
    adds a property row. The Property Name column allows the property name to be edited. Clicking on 
    the Property Type will display a combo box with the possible property types, e.g. string, integer, 
    float etc. The Property Value column contains the property values. 
  </p>

  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/createLabel.png" width="274" height="335" alt="Create Label"></p>

  <p>
    Creates a label in the current cell on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current layer</a> 
    with name given by the Label Text field. A label is entered using a single left mouse click, which 
    defines the label's origin.  <em>Height</em> defines the label's height. <em>Presentation</em> is 
    the position of the origin relative to the text and can be one of topLeft, topCentre, topRight, 
    centreLeft, centreCentre, centreRight, bottomLeft, bottomCentre or bottomRight.
    <em>Orient</em> can be one of R0, R90, R180, R270, MX, MXR90, MY, MYR90.<em> Effects</em> 
    sets label effects such as <em>Underline</em>, <em>Overline</em> and <em>Strikethru</em>. 
    Note that label effects, although displayed visually, cannot be represented in e.g. GDS2 
    or OASIS and so will be lost on export.

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Path...<a name="create_path"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/createPath.png" width="448" height="401" alt="Create Path"></p>

  <p>
    Creates a path in the current cell 
    on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current layer</a>. A path is 
    entered using multiple left mouse clicks, with each click defining a path 
    point. The path entry <i>Snap Angle</i> can be one of Any, 90 degrees or 45 
    degrees. The path width can be set in the <i>Width</i> field, and the path 
    style can be set to one of Truncate, Octagon, Extend or VarExtend. In the 
    case of Extend, the path extent is set to half the path width. In the case 
    of VarExtend, independent beginning and ending extensions can be set. Path 
    entry is terminated by hitting the return key, or by double clicking on the 
    final point required. Pressing the backspace key backs up the path by one 
    vertex i.e. deletes the last entered point. If an existing routed path is 
    selected before invoking Create Path, the form is seeded with the path's net 
    name and the layer of the existing path.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the layer is a routing layer 
    (has its FUNCTION set in the techfile to ROUTING) then the 'u' and 'd' keys 
    can be used to switch up or down to the next routing layer during path entry. 
    A via will be placed if a valid via between the two layers exists. If an existing 
    net shape is selected, the <i>Net</i> and <i>Layer</i> fields are pre-seeded 
    based on the net shape, and the <i>Width</i> field is set to that layer's 
    minimum width.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Shield sides</i>, if checked, 
    results in shield paths generated to the sides of the entered path, in the 
    same layer as the path. The width of the side shield paths is set by <i>Side 
    Width</i> and the spacing from the shield to the path is set by <i>Side Spacing</i>. 
    <i>Shield top/bottom</i>, if checked, results in shield paths on top of and 
    below the entered path, with the bottom shield on the next routing layer below 
    the path, and the top shield on the next routing layer above the path. The 
    routing order is as set in the techfile by the layer FUNCTION statements - 
    the the first layer with a FUNCTION of ROUTING is the lowest layer. The widths 
    of the top and bottom shields are set by <i>Top/Bottom Width</i>. If Shield 
    Net is set then the shields will be assigned to the net name specified; if 
    it does not exist it will be created.
  </p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;MultPartPath...
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/createMPP.png" alt=""Create MultipartPath></p>

  <p>
    Creates a Multi Part Path (MPP). A MPP is defined in the techfile e.g. as below:
  </p>

  <p>
    //<br>
    // MultiPartPath rules<br>
    //<br>
    MPP nguard LAYER nwell drawing WIDTH 1.80 BEGEXT 0.90 ENDEXT 0.9 ;<br>
    MPP nguard LAYER od&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drawing WIDTH 1.18 BEGEXT 0.59 ENDEXT 0.59 ;<br>
    MPP nguard LAYER nimp&nbsp;&nbsp; drawing WIDTH 1.54 BEGEXT 0.77 ENDEXT 0.77 ;<br>
    MPP nguard LAYER cont&nbsp;&nbsp; drawing WIDTH 0.16 BEGEXT -0.08 ENDEXT 0.08 SPACE 0.18 LENGTH 0.16 ;<br>
    MPP nguard LAYER metal1 drawing WIDTH 0.60 BEGEXT 0.30 ENDEXT 0.30 ;<br>
  </p>

  <p>
    A MPP is like a path in that it is defined as a set of vertices. A MPP may contain several layers. 
    Each layer must have a nonzero WIDTH and a BEGEXT and ENDEXT which may be 
    negative, positive or zero. The layer is justified to the segments of connected 
    vertices i.e. it extends a half width either side of the path. The BEGEXT is the 
    distance past the first vertex of the path that the 
    layer starts, the ENDEXT is the distance past the last vertex of the path that 
    the layer stops. If the layer has a SPACE and a LENGTH then it is assumed to 
    be a repetitive contact structure, i.e. rectangles with WIDTH and LENGTH 
    seperated by SPACE are generated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently MPP paths must be manhattan only. MPPs when exported to GDS / OASIS etc. 
    are converted to polygons i.e. they are flattenned.
  </p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Polygon<a name="create_polygon"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/createPolygon.png" width="268" height="130" alt="Create Polygon"></p>

  <p>
    Creates a polygon in the current cell on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current 
    layer</a>. A polygon is entered using multiple left mouse clicks, with each click defining a 
    vertex of the polygon. The polygon entry snap angle can be one of Any, 90 degrees 
    or 45 degrees. After two points have been entered, a dotted blue 'closure 
    line' is shown. Hitting return at this stage completes the polygon according 
    to the closure line. Polygons can also be finished by double clicking on a 
    point. Pressing the backspace key backs up the polygon by one vertex i.e. 
    deletes the last entered point.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Rectangle<a name="create_rectangle"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p>
    Creates a rectangle in the current 
    cell on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current layer</a>. A rectangle 
    is entered using two left mouse clicks, or a single click if Infix Mode is 
    set. The first point (or the current cursor position if Infix mode is set) 
    defines a vertex of the rectangle. A rubber band box is drawn showing the 
    extent of the rectangle during mouse movement. Clicking on the second point 
    completes the rectangle.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Via...<a name="create_via"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <h4 align="center"><img src="images/createVia.png" width="252" height="134"></h4>

  <p>
    Creates a via in the current cell.<i> 
    Via Name</i> is the name of an existing via in the library. <i>Net </i>is 
    the name of the net that this via is assigned to.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Pin...<a name="create_pin"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/createPin.png" width="274" height="231" alt="Create Pin"></p>

  <p>
    Creates a pin in the current cell. 
    <i>Pin Name</i> is the name of the pin, <i>Net Name</i> is the name of the 
    net that the pin belongs to. If the net does not exist it will be created. 
    If an existing net shape is selected, <i>Net Name</i> is seeded with the selected 
    net's name. <i>Use</i> determines the pin's type. <i>Direction </i>sets the 
    pin's direction. The pin is created on the layer selected by the layer chooser 
    field. Normally a pin purpose layer would be used.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Ellipse...<a name="create_ellipse"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/createEllipse.png" width="288" height="139" alt="Create Ellipse"></p>

  <p>
    Creates an ellipse in the current 
    cell on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current layer</a>. Ellipses 
    are entered using two left mouse clicks, or a single click if<a href="view_menu.htm#infix_mode"> 
    Infix mode</a> is set. The first point (or the current cursor position if 
    Infix mode is set) defines one corner of the ellipse's bounding box, and the 
    second point defines the opposite corner of the ellipse's bounding box. <i>Radius 
    snap grid</i> is the snap grid (usually the manufacturing grid) to snap the 
    ellipse's bounding box to. <i>Number of segments</i> is the number of line 
    segments used to represent the circle on export to GDS2 or OASIS.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Arc...<a name="create_arc"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p>
    Creates an arc in the current cell on the <a href="theLSW.htm#set_current_layer">current layer</a>. 
    Arcs are entered using three left mouse clicks, or two clicks if<a href="view_menu.htm#infix_mode"> 
    Infix mode</a> is set. The first click defines the centre of a circle that has the required arc on 
    its circumference. 
    The second click defines the radius of that circle, and the first point of the arc. The third click 
    defines the span angle from the first point. The arc will be drawn clockwise or anticlockwise 
    depending on the start angle and the stop angle. Note that arcs cannot be output to 
    e.g. GDS2 or OASIS as they are line objects. They are intended for use with the symbol editor only.
  </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
    Create-&gt;Group...</strong><a name="create_group"></a>
  </font></h4>

  <p align="center"><img src="images/creategroup.png" width="307" height="143"></p>

  <p>
    Creates a group of objects. If a group is moved, all the objects within the group are moved. 
    Similarly if a group is copied or rotated, all the object in the group are copied or rotated. 
    Groups behave like pseudo instances, but without any physical hierarchy.  
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a group, either preselect objects; Create Group will create a group with name given by 
    <em>Name</em>, and add the selected objects to the group. Or, if nothing is selected, the user 
    is prompted to select objects to add to the group. Cancel or pressing ESC will cancel selecting 
    objects to add. The group orientation is set by <em>Orientation</em>, and can subsequently be 
    changed by selecting and querying the group.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that groups can contain other groups; a group cannot have itself as a member to avoid infinite recursion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Groups are displayed as a rectangular shape on the <em>group</em> system layer, which is set to 
    the bounding box of all the objects in the group. If the group's shape is selected it can be moved 
    or copied.
  </p>

  <p>
    To subsequently add or remove objects from a group, use the Edit-&gt;Add To Group or Edit-&gt;Remove From Group 
    commands.
  </p>

  <p>
    To ungroup objects, use the Edit-&gt;Ungroup command.
  </p>

  <p>
    Groups can be transparent, in which case the group shape is not selectable but the objects in the group are, 
    and can be moved independently. Transparency is set in the <em>View-&gt;Display Options</em> dialog. 
    If transparency is disabled then individual group members are not selectable, only the group shape is.
