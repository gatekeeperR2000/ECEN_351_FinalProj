      <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Glade FAQ</font></h2>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why is it called Glade?</font></h4>
      <p>
        Simple - Gds Lef And Def Editor. 
        Ok, so it now supports a few more formats.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Should I use the OpenGL version?</font></h4>

      <p>
        If you're running on Windows, the answer is most likely 
        yes, unless you've got a very old  graphics card. On Linux the situation 
        is a bit more complex but again if you've got a fairly recent 
        graphics card and have installed the vendor's drivers AND set Linux to use 3D graphics 
        acceleration, then you should be OK.   The big advantage of 
        OpenGL is hardware accelerated graphics and support for transparency of layers.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How do I turn off OpenGL?</font></h4>

      <p>
        Set the environment variable GLADE_USE_OPENGL 
        to NO. On Windows, right click on My Computer and then select the 'Properties' 
        item. In the dialog choose the 'Advanced' tab, then press the 'Environment 
        Variables' button. Click 'New' on the User Variables section and enter the 
        variable name and value as above. On Linux, set in your .bashrc
      </p>
      <p>
        export GLADE_USE_OPENGL=NO
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have a design kit with a Cadence 
        technology file / display resources file, can Glade read that directly?</font></h4>

      <p>
        In Version 4.0.6 and later it now 
        can. Be aware that there are some limitations - it can only handle stipple 
        patterns that are 32x32, 16x16, 8x8 or 4x4 bits; other sizes are rounded up 
        to the next power of two. It may also fail to read hand-edited display.drf 
        and techfiles, so make sure you've dumped the techfile from a Cadence technology 
        library.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        I have a design kit with a Silicon Canvas technology file / display resources file, 
        can Glade read that directly?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        In Version 4.0.42 and later it 
        now can. Be aware that there are some limitations - it can only handle stipple 
        patterns that are 32x32, 16x16, 8x8 or 4x4 bits; other sizes are rounded up 
        to the next power of two. It may also fail to read hand-edited display.drf 
        and techfiles, so make sure you've dumped the techfile from a Laker technology 
        library.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Why don't you support non-orthogonal AREFs?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        The GDS2 spec is sometimes interpreted  as allowing non-orthogonal arrays (arrays where 
        the row spacing and/or column spacings contain both X and Y components). Cadence, who 
        'own' the GDS2 spec, do not allow non-orthogonal arrays in their translators. So to 
        maintain interoperability, Glade does not either.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Why don't you support SREF/AREF magnification?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        As of version 4.1.2 Glade now supports 
        magnification. With some trickery this comes at no memory or runtime overhead. 
        However, it is almost never really needed and other tools may not support 
        it, so beware.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Why don't you support all-angle SREF/AREF placement?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Most people don't require it, Cadence Virtuoso does not 
        support it. In theory it can be supported at no overhead but will require a lot 
        of changes to the UI and careful testing. So if you really, really need it let 
        us know and it could be added to the roadmap.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Why don't you support feature XYZ?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Well, maybe we don't know about it. Mail support@peardrop.co.uk and tell us what you 
        need. Nothing is promised, but your request may be (a) interesting or (b) simple to 
        implement. So feel free to suggest.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        I've found a bug.
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Please email support@peardrop.co.uk and 
        describe the problem as accurately as you can. Again we cannot promise to 
        fix all bugs but so far all the reproducible ones that have been reported have 
        been fixed. A small test case, if possible, greatly increases the chance 
        of reproducing the problem.
      </p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        I tried to run LVS but get an error.
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        You need to run extraction on a layout view before running LVS in order to identify 
        devices (MOS, resistor etc) and generate connectivity info. 
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Can you read Calibre/Hercules/Assura/PVS DRC rules?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        No, sorry, not directly; the formats are proprietary. You may be able to translate rules 
        into Glade's format, but there is no guarantee that all rules are supported. If there is 
        a type of rule you need that is missing, let us know and it may be possible to implement it.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Do you support Cadence Skill / Cadence PCells?
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        No, sorry, Skill is a Cadence proprietary language based on Lisp which was popular in the 1980's. 
        Glade uses Python which is not proprietary and there are plenty of tools to help write and debug 
        Python code. Cadence PCells can only be evaluated by Virtuoso, so they cannot be used outside the 
        Cadence environment.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        I get a message 'Failed to import ui module - please check your PYTHONPATH environment variable!'
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Glade tries to import the Python wrappers for the gui and database from a file called ui.py, which 
        is located in the distribution directory. Python import uses a search path, set in the environment 
        variable PYTHONPATH, to look for this file (and python PCells, if you use them). See the platform 
        installation instructions on how to set an environment variable.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">   
        I'm trying to wire a schematic but nothing happens when I try and add a wire
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Check if you are using the autorouter (the 'route' option if you display the Create Wire dialog / 
        hit F3 key). The autorouter obeys the schematic snap grid (Display Options-&gt;Snap Grid); if the 
        pins of components in your schematic are not on the snap grid then it is unable to route. For 
        the example library, a snap grid of 0.0625 (inch) is recommended.
      </p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">  
        I netlist a design using  File-&gt;Export CDL... but all instances in the netlist are missing the 
        connecting nets.
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        The netlister uses the NLPDeviceFormat property on symbol instances when netlisting a schematic to 
        format the entries in the netlist for each instance. If this is incorrect or missing, the netlist 
        will have the instance name but the nets will be missing. See the section on symbol creation for 
        the syntax and usage of the NLPDeviceFormat property.
      </p>
