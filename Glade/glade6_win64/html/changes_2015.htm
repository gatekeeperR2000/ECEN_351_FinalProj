  <h4 align="left">Contents for 2014 can be found <a href="changes_2014.htm">here</a></h4>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.37 release on 04/01/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: reads Cadence techfile with extra system layer numbers / purposes</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.38 release on 30/1/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: moving circles/arcs/allipses caused 
    a crash</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: Query dialog can now change 
    multiple instance master lib / cell / view, e.g. replace all selected instances 
    of cellA with cellB.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: non-editable fields of query 
    dialog greyed out</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.39 release on 06/02/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: fixed crash if expanding cells with 
    unbound instances</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Various bugs fixed when trying to 
    create instances in a second library whose master cellViews were in the 
    first.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: added a 'Create CellView' to 
    the library browser (RMB on the library to see the popup of options)</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: improved the Cadence techfile 
    parser. Creates layers defined in the GDS layermap file even if not in the 
    techfile. Handles lines with pattern '_NA_'. Handles defaultPackets.</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.40 release on 22/02/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: round corners undo/redo was not 
    implemented. This has now been done.</p>
  <p align="left">- hierarchy browser 'ascend' still treeated 
    child cell as to cell for editing, even though top cell was displayed.</p>
  <p align="left">- Snap grid error messages were 
    incorrect.</p>
  <p align="left">- Docs had dbObj and derived 
    classes 'left/SetLeft, right/setRight, bottom/setBottom, top/setTop methods 
    described differently from the geometry 'Rect'. These have been corrected. Mote 
    that trying to set a bounding boc coord for a dbObj is only going to work for a 
    rectangle object! All others will cause an exception as they are illogical.</p>
  <p align="left">- get/setXLo / xHi etc. methods for Rect 
    object deprecated for Rect class. They still work, but please use 
    left/right/top/bottom methods instead.The old methods will eventually be 
    removed.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: library browser 'Delete Library' 
    option renamed 'Close Library' and a check is done for modified cells and the 
    user give the option to save them. Libraries are NOT deleted by glade. If you 
    really want to delete a library and all its cells, delete the library directory 
    via your OS. </p>
  <p align="left">- fixed a bug in the chop cmd. Undo and redo 
    work correctly now.</p>
  <p align="left">- fixed a bug in undo/redo in non-OpenGL 
    mode.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.41 release on 01/03/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: *.db files now included in 
    Import GDS dialog, as Calibre writes GDS with .db extensions.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: *.drc.results files now 
    included in Import Calibre errors file, as Calibre now writes errors with this 
    extension.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: LSW 'Show Cell Layers' could 
    sometimes cause a crash.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: LSW 'Show Viewport Layers' could 
    sometimes cause a crash.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug in the reshape cmd for 
    paths/polygons that could cause a crash.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a grid error that could cause 
    a crash in Edit-&gt;TiledBooleans.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: fixed some more undo/redo bugs.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: added shape * 
    castToShape(dbObj *) function for python where results are dbObjs, but you want 
    shapes....</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: cellView::dbRoundCorners() now 
    returns the shape it has rounded, rather than a boolean. Fixed to improve 
    regression testing.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: Query dialog now shows the 
    number of selected items. The next and previous buttons are greyed out if there 
    are no more next or previous items in the selected set.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: 'Close Library'&nbsp;only closes 
    all cellViews associated with this library, not ones open from another library. 
    It checks if any cells have been modified in the lib and prompts the user to 
    save them.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.42 release on 15/03/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- Update to version 5.8 of LEF/DEF reader. 
    'new' constructs are currently silently ignored and hence will not be written 
    back. Hopefully this will change in the near future.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: LSW 'Make System Layers Visible' 
    was not working.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: outputting GDS2 from a cellView 
    containing vias (e.g. fro LEF/DEF input) was not outputting the vias...</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: with two MDI windows open and 
    tiled, the view level was getting reset switching between windows.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.43 release on 24/3/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: fixed occasional crashes when using 
    the lib browser to create libraries/cellViews...</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: there is a serialisation bug in a 
    couple of Qt classes that means different binary data is written by QDataStream 
    for&nbsp;Qt 4.8.x and 5.x. This means a Windows lib can't be read by a Linux/Mac 
    machine and vice versa. To work around this until I have a better solution, 
    there are two env vars you can use to get round this: GLADE_READ_48_LIBS allows 
    a Windows machine to read a Linux Glade library, and GLADE_WRITE_48_LIBS allows 
    a Linux machine to write libraries that have been written by a Windows machine. 
    Of course, only use the former on Windows and the latter on Linux!</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: ui::compareCells could crash if 
    given a bad layer number </p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit has been 
    converted to Qt 5.4. Not without some pain! But this means its libraries will be 
    fully compatible with current Windows versions without the need for the env vars 
    as above. It is also planned to do the same conversion to 14.04 32 bit version. 
    As for e.g. CentOs 6, that is next to be converted.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.44 release on 13/4/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Edit-&gt;Bindkeys was not working 
    correctly.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Some library browser menu commands 
    were incorrect.</p>
  <p align="left">- workaround: For OSX with a Retina display, 
    OpenGL is automatically disabled until the scaling bug is resolved.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: All versions except CentOS 5 
    have been converted to Qt 5.4. Unfortunately, it does not seem possible to build 
    Qt5 on CentOS5...</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: It is now possible to re-read 
    the same DEF file without a crash. The existing cellview created from the 
    previous imported DEF is deleted (and its window closed if open) and a new 
    cellview will be created. </p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug where 
    Edit-&gt;Layers-&gt;Create... and Delete... were not displaying their 
    dialogs.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.45 release on 03/04/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- upgrade: Qt 5.4.1 on Mac OSX has Retina 
    display bugs fixed thanks to a patch from the Qt folks, so now works fully under 
    OpenGL.</p>
  <p align="left">- upgrade: Windows 32/64/xp versions upgraded 
    to Qt 5.4.1.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Floorplan-&gt;Create Group did not 
    delete groups.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfx: Deleting a system layer is not 
    allowed any more.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Editing bindkeys was not changing 
    them.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.46 release on 15/05/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: hierarcy browser can switch 
    betweeen cell names ( the default) and inst names)</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: Mac version now has Window 
    menu working correctly.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.47 release on 21/05/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Windows versions now find the 
    distributed python libs etc. even if glade is started from the cmd window in 
    some other directory.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: some minor code errors that could 
    cause a crash fixed.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Version 4.4.48 release on 30/05/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: geomAllowedWidths() reported false 
    errors</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: Option when exporting PINs in 
    LEF to export shapes as seperate PORTs instead of the default, which is to 
    output all shapes as a single PORT.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Version 4.4.49 release on 05/06/2015</strong></p>
  <p>- bugfix: CDL  netlist flattener for LVS failed if global nets were declared</p>
  <p align="left"></p>
  <p><strong>Version 4.4.50 release on 21/06/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: circular holes created using 
    boolean ops could sometimes miss a vertex.</p>
  <p align="left">- enhancement: cv.dbCreateCircle() and 
    cv.dbCreateEllipse() now take a fourth argument which is the number of segments 
    the circle is represented by, when converted to e.g. GDS2, OASIS, boolean ops, 
    or drawing. Previously this was 128 - if the argument is not set, it defaults to 
    128.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: vertical/horizontal flags in 
    geom....() commands were incorrect.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: multithreaded connectivity was 
    turned off unless the GLADE_THREADED_EXTRACTION env var was set to the number of 
    threads (i.e. logical cores available). Now, if this env var is not set, the 
    maximum number of available cores will be used</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.51 release on 29/06/2015</strong></p>
  <p align="left">- patch fix for a bug in 
    cellView::geomCreateHole()</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

  <p align="left">- Gravity to path centrline/outline made 
    radio buttons as you can't have both.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: Path bounding box fixed for 
    non-manhattan paths.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: running tiled boolean checks in 
    non-threaded mode did not obey the operation code.</p>
  <p align="left">- bugfix: renaming a cell in the lib browser 
    deleted the cell.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Version 4.4.54 release on 24/10/2015</strong></p>
