<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.27 release on 07/01/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Schematic Create Layout dialog did not set current library to that of the current cellView.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import EDIF failed on some examples.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Invalid instance pins could cause an exception, now more gracefully handled.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: improvements to arc drawing code.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create CellView added cellName to NLPDeviceFormat property, now uses [@modelName] </p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL now supports using NLPDeviceFormat property on extraction PCells for user-defined netlist formatting.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.28 release on 21/01/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: File-&gt;Exit with edited cells did not cancel if 'Cancel' button clicked.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export CDL from extracted view with parasitics reported parasitics twice if 'merge parasitics' selected.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added Cancel button to Create Instance dialog.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added defaultParams property setup for Create CellView from CellView command..</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added Cross View Check to Schematic->Check and Symbol->Check menus. Checks that each view of a
library cell has same number of pins, there are matching pin names, and pin directions match.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import EDIF was incorrectly overwriting schematic info into symbol views since last version.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.29 release on 28/01/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash if e.g. Create Via bindkey (v) clicked while in symbol editor.</p>

<p align="left">- enhancement: Descend Hierarchy pre-seeds view name option to current view name.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL dialog remembers last switch list name setting.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: PCell submaster names are now of the form &lt;cellName&gt;$$12345678, where the number is a hashed string result. This removes an issue where long PCell submaster names caused issues with filesystems with 256 character limits, such as Windows.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added option to open new cellView when created using library browser or File-&gt;New Cell...</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Symbol now has pins displayed in a table for easier setting of side. Pin style feature added for e.g. inverted or clock pins.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Symbol has user defined wire stub length and pin size options.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: vsrc/isrc instName Spice prefix support was broken in Schematic-&gt;Check.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Map table entries for schematic Layout-&gt;Map Devices could be shown multiple times. Now duplicate entries eliminated when opening a library.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Inatance dialog did not show all views of a cell sometimes.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.31 release on 09/02/2018</strong></p>

<p align="left">- enhancement: Python function getPropList() implemented for dbObj derived classes to get a Python list of properties.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Exporting GDS2 with via objects could create multiple STRUCT definitions.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export GDS2 can now export PCell property information if desired. Import GDS2 can read this information to allow PCell info to be saved/restored via GDS2. Note that this info is exported as GDS2 properties, and may be incompatible with other GDS2 readers. It has been tested with Cadence which can read this GDS2 however use at your own risk.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Creating a PCell supermaster set bounding box to 5x5um unnecessarily. Now sets actual bounding box.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Generate Layout from netlist will check if subcircuits (X devices in netlist) are present. If an X device has a master cell in the library with view &quot;layout&quot; then an instance of that cell will be created in the generated layout. </p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Generate Layout from schematics will ignore an instance if it has a 'nlAction' string property with value 'ignore'</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Paths with type ROUNDED were not drawn using fill pattern.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Polygons with holes sometimes did not draw with fill pattern.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Layout view labels were not directly scaled to dbu. Now a label's 'height' is as defined by its height attribute. Note that you might need to set the label size scale factor in the Display Options dialog for e.g. labels with a height of 1 now.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.63 release on 04/11/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Chop cmd didn't always create a hole, if a hole existed in the result.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Export CDL from a hierarchical netlist with parasitic capacitors gave same set of capacitors for every subcircuit.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Netlisting parasitic caps merges caps with pins swapped, and filters caps with pins on the same net.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.65 release on 16/11/2018</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Arrays with certain row/col info could be read incorrectly.</p>
