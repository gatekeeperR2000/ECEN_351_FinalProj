<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.20 release on 06/01/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: CDL netlisting combined into single dialog. Both flat and hierarchical netlisting will use symbol view NLPDeviceFormat for pin order list, if a symbol view exists.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic Display Options dialog has 'Instance Names' field which allows setting instance names to be 'Preserve' or 'Force Spice compatible'. The former will keep instance names as-is during Check. The latter will change the prefix character to be spice-compatible, depending on the &quot;type&quot; property of the instance master.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL checks the last extracted date of all cellviews hierarchically from the current cellView down.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export Verilog does not escape identifiers that don't need to be escaped.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export Verilog can now netlist hierarchical schematics.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed an issue where creating a PCell instance with properties which do not exist as formal parameters of the python function for the PCell would cause an error.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: geomEnclose() added optional 'flags' parameter for 'abut' flag. Else abutment of edges is considered a violation.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.21 release on 15/01/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: CDL flattener now does not require a '/' character to delimit pins from subckt name in a subckt call.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added cell name mapping to OASIS import/export.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.22 release on 22/01/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: removed error if netlist had extra spaces at end of line in Generate Layout.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: map devices command in netlist window now removes row that is selected, rather than last row.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: map devices command in netlist window allows selection of row rather than individual items.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: map devices command in netlist window did not update underlying data if rows were removed.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: map devices command in netlist window did not map according to instances correctly.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: querying PCell properties gave spurious warnings about not being able to find python module in PYTHONPATH entries.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.23 release on 27/01/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: New Gemini option -P. If used together with -w (report property mismatches), it will match by device properties. If not used, the default will be used, i.e. matching by nets/devices but not considering properties, which can result in a netlist match, but property mismatch. Use of this option may slow matching.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: New Gemini option -L. If used and the netlist has a top level .subckt, the pins are used as initial equivalence nodes. Mismatching name of number of nodes between the two netlists will be reported.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: LEF reader now reports first 10 ports missing port shapes, then continues silently to avoid excessive errors if well taps are used.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed some dialog layout issues on Mac.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.24 release on 05/02/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash when stretching a starting or ending segment of a MPP</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create/Move/Stretch of shapes can use layer colour/fill rather than outline yellow.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Online DRC spacing check performed when creating / moving / stretching shapes. Requires layer minSpace attribute set in technology file.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.25 release on 12/02/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash when e.g. moving labels.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a bug in hierarchical netlist flattening (e.g. when running LVS). The flattener omitted the *.SCALE keyword from the netlist, so Gemini thinks all dimensions are in microns, and so a width of e.g. 1u is read as 1e-12 - and hence showed as zero in the property comparison report.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Various DRC check enhancements</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Saving a cell now checks if the existing library version is less than the current library version, if so updates the existing library. This gets round a potential problem if users save cells using a newer version of Glade to a library created with an older version, without saving the whole lib.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug in online DRC with paths in OpenGL mode where the halo was shown incorrectly.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug in create MPP which could cause vertices to be reordered in OpenGL mode.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic Create Pin dialog remembers previous direction/use.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug that could occasionally cause a crash when viewing DRC error markers.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a potential crash when using the Verify-&gt;DRC-&gt;View Errors... error dialog and clicking on 'Next' or 'Prev'.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Verify-&gt;DRC-&gt;View Errors... now uses highlighting to indicate the current error marker (shown in purple). Use Selection Options 'Dim unhilited objects' to make the current violation clearer.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Import Cadence techfile no reads std. via definitions.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a bug descending hierarchy.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug using hierarchy browser to descend/ascend hierarchy.</p>
<p align="left">- fixed an occasional crash after a design window was closed, e.g. when deleting a cell/cellView in the library browser.</p>
<p align="left">- fixed a crash is chop command given with a zero width or height chop rectangle.</p>
<p align="left">- fixed an issue writing GDS where instances could have master cells in other libraries.</p>
<p align="left">- fixed an issue in OpenGL mode where instances could not be moved using the move cmd.</p>
<p align="left">- allow use of '\n' character sequence in NLP label expressions to cause newlines in displayed label text.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.27 release on 26/02/2017</strong></p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed some issues drawing text in schematics.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash when undoing a delete of certain objects.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: improved symbol editor Check cmd. Now removes nets and pins which have no shape.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Shorted resistors would give an error. Now they are preserved on extraction.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Windows pathnames given in e.g. DRC or LPE dialog could give file not found errors if they contained escaped characters e.g. user\test would see the \t as a tab character.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.28 release on 06/03/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added schematic check options dialog.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Floorplan-&gt;Place updated so can read DEF 5.8</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a schematic check bug that could result in floating pins.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash when Next violation clicked on in view DRC markers if no violations remaining.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Extract commands e.g. extractMOS() now search the list of open libraries for the extraction pcell, rather than just the current cellView's library.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.29 release on 13/03/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug that could cause occasional missing DRC violations.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: view marker errors zooms to bbox of highlighted shape, rather than a bbox including (0,0)</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: made schematic check options dialog a menu item; options are saved and maintained during a session.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: check schematic for floating pins caused pin shapes to move if error.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.30 release on 24/03/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a display issue with schematics displaying NLP labels with linefeed (\n) characters.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: spaces can be entered in NLP expressions using '\s'</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: schematic check for shorted output pins.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Gemini now reduces series RLC and parallel RLC. Devices must be of the same model type. Values are summed (series RL, parallel C) or reciprocals added (parallel RL, series C). The option -a controls series reduction, -b controls parallel reduction.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL loads/saves options for global nets, switchList and stopList to settings file.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: LVS dialog now saves option state during session.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: global nets (ones ending with '!') handled in the export CDL and LVS dialogs.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug in CDL flattener where the *.SCALE was always written as MICRON, which could cause LVS to give property errors.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: LVS now writes a &lt;cellName&gt;.lvs report file to the working directory containing the gemini output.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: LVS now will take a schematic view instead of a netlist file if required. The schematic is automatically netlisted and flattened prior to running Gemini.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.31 release on 30/03/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Deleting a wire in schematics deletes any solder dots at the ends of the wire.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: geomArea() reported incorrectly for shapes with holes.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: geomSpace / geomSpace2 with width argument now also has a length value. Only parallel run lengths &gt; length are checked. This avoids issues with perpendicular tracks.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Wire entry in schematics now supports additional snap options: HV (horizontal first), VH (Vertical first), horizontal, vertical.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.32 release on 07/04/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: schematic device instances can be grouped for layout generation. Selected devices are assigned to a named group, groups can be added to, removed from or deleted. Grouped devices are placed together in a grid.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Layout generation now generates boundary shape with either square shaped based on device area and utilisation, or can have fixed W / H / W+H.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Layout generation has a pin editor allowing pin width/side/layer to be controlled.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Wire and Create Path commands have extra snapping modes. In addition to 90/45/any angle there is now Horizontal first then vertical, Vertical first then horizontal, Horizontal only and Vertical only.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Querying and changing an array of PCell instances collapsed the array into a single instance. Now the array is preserved correctly.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Deleting a property using the Query dialog didn't delete the actual property, only the entry in the dialog. Now it deletes the property and gives info on what was deleted.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Deleting a cellView in the library browser would close all open cells with the same name. Now only closes the matching cellView.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.33 release on 10/04/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: When creating a new wire, if the start or end coincides with the start or end of an existing wire, the two wires will be merged.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Gemini LVS will match R/L/C devices by L/W if the devices do not have a value (resistance etc)</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic Layout Generation now has an 'Edit Group' command which allows you to set the pattern (a 2D grid) for placement of the devices in the group.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic Layout Generation now snaps instance origins to the layout grid.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Add Marker command added a marker when Apply was clicked, but not when OK was clicked.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: rounding error when inserting vertical edges that intercepted with edges non-manhattan edges could cause boolean engine errors.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.5.34 release on 21/04/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: ruler snap angle change would cause existing rulers to change.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: create group and rename group in schematics warns if an attempt is made to create or rename to an existing group name.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: when reducing series RLC devices in LVS, a port could be removed if it had only 1 connection to a device.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: adding a wire created a solder dot at start and finish.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Instance could go into infinite loop on placing an instance in a cellView.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.0 release on 07/05/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- Display canvas improvements to both raster and OpenGL canvas. No longer draws on a QWidget/QGLWidget. Always renders to offscreen framebuffer (in OpenGL mode uses GPU for blitting).</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a bug in non-OpenGL mode where selection outlines in edit in place were incorrectly transformed.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Layer colours in LSW stripped of alpha component to make them more visible.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Library saves view type (library version 500).</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: thread based OpenGL and raster drawing.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: enabling DRD mode could corrupt polygon shapes in hierarchical designs.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: DRD did not flag errors to polygon shapes in instances that had certain orientations.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Finishing a wire in schematics on an existing wire end generated a superfluous solder dot.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Undo a wire that added a solder dot on creation did not undo any solder dot created.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: In schematics, descending hierarchy without 'Always show option dialogs' did not show the dialog for the view to descend into, so always descended into a schematic view, creating one if it did not exist. Now the Descend Hierarchy dialog is always displayed.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: message window made read-only.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a sporadic crash in the OpenGL rendering thread.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.1 release on 12/05/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Specifying the GLADE_USE_OPENGL env var with any value (not just 'no') would turn off OpenGL mode.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: In schematics, starting a new wire on an existing wire endpoint then hitting 'escape' to abort the command would delete the existing wire. </p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: In schematics, entering a wire that ended on an existing wire could delete a wire point.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Zoom out by dragging top-&gt;bottom would zoom in since 4.6.0 changes.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: hierarchical netlisting stopped on 1st valid stop list view, not the 1st valid view that also has a NLPDeviceFormat prop.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: saving extracted views allowed. Beware: do not try and re-extract an extracted view!</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: various crashed when closing active windows due to library browser close cell / close cellView cmd.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: m factor instances of pcells were not having m factor stripped before pcell generation.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: NLP property evaluation looks up a level of the hierarchy from an instance if it does not find a property. So instead of expecting properties on pcell instances, it now looks at trhe correct location which is the pcell submaster.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: filtering/merging parasitic caps allowed now in the hierarchical CDL netlister.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug with cursor size on schematics &amp; symbols withscaled display pixels.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: extraction code rationalised to use units of metres for device W/L etc. NB: your pcells might need to be altered to be compatible!</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a potential crash if a window was closed and another window was clicked in.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export CDL used *.SCALE METRES when units of metres was selected, this has been changed to *.SCALE METER to be more hspice compatible.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">- enhancement: Added support for paths with rounded ends.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.7 release on 07/07/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Several bugfixes to boolean engine to make it more robust with any angle geometries. Fixed a couple of issues that could lead to crashes or incorrect scanline ordering.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import dialogs now show library as 'default' if no other library apart from 'basic' is open. This is to stop importing into 'basic' by accident.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: File-&gt;Exit could cause Glade to hang with an empty crash dialog displayed.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Use locale info for date/time rather than UTC. Fixes a bug where schematic extraction date could be incorrect compared to cell modification date.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.11 release on 14/08/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Setting a path to ROUND extension during entry set the extents to 0, rather than half the width, causing incorrect rendering.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed an issue with schematic group editing whereby changing row/column count was not persistent.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Instances in schematic group editor initialised to R0 orientation, rather than that of the schematic.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Clean up display of unused row/columns in schematic group editor.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Adding dummy instances in schematic group editor now sets unique colour for the instances (gray).</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.15 release on 25/09/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a crash that could occur when writing a CDL netlist with unbound instance masters.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: -open &lt;libName&gt; in the command line rebinds open libraries.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: added -library command line keyword with equivalent meaning to -open, i.e. specifies a library to open.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export graphics from layout view gave image mirrored about X axis.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Bounding box of instances not recomputed if origin subsequently changed. This could cause selection issues.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.16 release on 06/10/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Scale cmd did not scale line objects. Also set default scale snap grid for schematics vs. layout views.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: drawing arcs in instances with orientation MX/MXR90/MY/MYR90 was incorrect.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: cellView now supports independent dbuPerUU/userUnits from library. Saved to disk in library version 520 on.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: schematics and symbol viewTypes default to 160 dbu/user unit, with user units inches. This is compatible with Cadence schematics. You can update old cellViews by opening the old cellView, setting the dbuPerUU to 160 and userUnits to inches, then run Edit-&gt;Scale and scale by 0.16. If you do NOT want to use the new 'basic' library and retain the old dbu for your schematics/symbols, set the env var &quot;GLADE_OLD_SCH_DBU&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Display cellView's dbuPerUU / userUnits in query dialog.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed some issues displaying text orientation correctly in rotated schematic instances.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Via origins were not shown when creating a via or moving a via.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Query dialog sets correct path begin/end extensions when path style is changed.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a potential crash when cross-probingnets without port shapes.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Saving a schematic changed its modified date even if the cellView had not been edited, thus requiring it to be checked again before netlisting.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Query dialog path style / via type combo fields filled multiple times.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Path was not setting current layer each time which could cause a new path to be generated in an old layer.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.17 release on 15/10/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: labels with orientation MX/MY were shown flipped</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Preliminary import and export EDIF command implemented. Only tested so far on Cadence EDIF 2.0.0.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a potential crash selecting labels.</p>
<p align="left">- fixed a potential crash when creating an instance without verifying the cellName/viewName are correct in the dialog first.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.18 release on 28/10/2017</strong></p>

<p align="left">- enhancement: Immediate mode move/stretch has option (display options dialog/miscellaneous) for items to remain selected after move/stretch. </p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Trace Net command rewritten using trapezoidal decomposition algorithm. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.19 release on 31/11/2017</strong></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.20 release on 05/11/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: CellViews can be opened in read only mode. Or, File-&gt;Make ReadOnly will set a cellView readonly, and File-&gt;Make Editable will make it editable again. A readonly cellView will give a warning dialog if an attempt is made to modify it, and ask the user whether they want to make it editable. Also, File-&gt;Save is disabled for readonly cellViews.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: SVG can be saved in black&amp;white. Select 'monochrome' in the Export Image dialog. Note this only currently works for SVG, not PNG or JPG.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: schematic Create CellView command now displays a dialog with pin names/sides so you can edit the pin order or side. You can also choose a rectangular, triangular or circular symbol shape to be generated.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Yank/Paste commands implemented. Selecting objects and using the yank command copies them to a buffer; the objects can then be pasted in another cellView using the Paste command.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Net use attibute was not saved to DB on disk.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Edit In Place was not showing EIP cell in context correctly.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.21 release on 12/11/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Writing GDS2 from an autoLayout view (from importing LEF/DEF) generated clashing instance names for via instances.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added option to split polygons during GDS2 export if more than a user-specified number of vertices.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.22 release on 26/11/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: initial implementation of bus handling for schematics. Buses can be named e.g. A&lt;0:3&gt; signifying a 4 bit bus with component signals A&lt;0&gt;, ... A&lt;3&gt;. The schematic check tool understands buses and bus taps. Pins can have bus expressions, and nets connected to them will become buses of equivalent width. The netlisters and layout generation from schematics have been updated to handle bus nets.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: vector instances supported e.g. I0&lt;0:3&gt; signifying a 4 bit vector instance. The netlisters and layout generation from schematics have been updated to handle vector instances.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Bus command creates a wide wire for buses</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: line object (used for wires) was not saving width to library, or maintaining width on copy.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Query dialog allows changing line object width.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic check tool can snap label origins to wires, within a user-specified snap distance.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create CellView from CellView did not create symbols with dbu of 160, instead it was using the value inherited from the library. Now all cellView creation obeys the rules: schematic and symbol viewTypes are created with dbuPerUU of 160 and userUnits of inches, whereas all other viewTypes (maskLayout, abstract etc) inherit their dbuPerUU / userUnits from the library.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Floating pins on an instance could give incorrect netlist when exporting from schematics.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: saveInterconnect() saves pin info for abstract view generation.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: saveInterconnect() doesn't save dummy net info for abstract view generation.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a crash when deleting a library that had given an error when opening.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Instance command did not remember current lib/cell/view.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.23 release on 03/12/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: View markers did not zoom to first selected marker correctly.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic and Symbol check opened new window when called from Python, now does not need to open a canvas if not already open.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Copying a vector instance did not copy vector info.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Delete a schematic wire now deletes any attached wire labels.</p>
<p>- enhancement: Schematic check gives error if bus width and pin width / instance vector width mismatch. The rules are:<br>
    1. A bus net can connect to a vector instance pin if the instance vector size is the same as the bus bits size.<br>
    2. A single bit net can connect to a vector instance pin; all instances will then connect to the net via that pin.<br>
    3. A bus net can connect to a bus instance pin of the same width.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Checking of duplicate bus net names. If a bus net is e.g. A&lt;0:3&gt; then there can be nets A&lt;0&gt;...A&lt;3&gt; but there cannot be a net A.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed an issue with bus net ordering with e.g. A&lt;3:0&gt; instead of A&lt;0:3&gt;</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Warning given in Schematic-&gt;Check for wire labels that do not attach to any wire.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Stretch wire segment now can lock endpoints of wire/path during stretch.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: dynamic highlight was not highlighting segments/vertices only when in partial select mode.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: fixed a bug in merge in geom... operations which could occur for edges that were slightly off manhattan.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a small bug introduced in 4.6.22 which drew rectangle sizes in symbols/schematics incorrectly.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Schematic check did not flag incorrect bus width to instance pin width errors.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Move Origin did not reset cellView bounding box, leading to e.g. subsequent window fit not fitting design.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Schematic check now sets bus nets to wide wires, other nets to thin wires.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Instance has option to set row/col spacing interactively. If number of rows and/or columns is &gt; 1, and the option is checked, the first point sets the array origin. The second sets the position of the first instance in the second row relative to the origin. And the third point sets the position of the first instance in the second column relative to the origin.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Create Instance for schematics creates a flattenned array of instances if number of rows/cols &gt; 1.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.24 release on 10/12/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import EDIF was incorrectly setting schematic viewType to symbol.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Import EDIF did not bind instances.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Importing arc construct in EDIF gave incorrect arc.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: various Import and Export EDIF bugs fixed.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Preferences file (.gladerc) has been migrated to XML format. Now, a gladerc.xml file will be loaded from the home directory when the app starts; preferences are app-based rather than canvas-based. If a gladerc.xml file is not found, an attempt is made to load any existing .gladerc file. Perferences are only saved back to a gladerc.xml file though.</p>
<p align="left">- Dialogs for Export CDL, Run LVS and Export Verilog have a new switchlist field which allows setting existing switch/stop lists defined in the XML preferences. Any modifications made in these dialogs are saved back to the selected swichlist name.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash that could occur when running DRC with MPPs.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create array with 1 row/multiple columns in interactive mode did not display array interactively.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Selecting an object in full mode and using stretch command did not move the object.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Undo/Redo fixed for stretching objects rather than segments/vertices.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: undo of stretched segments locked endpoints, and shouldn't.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: repeat command option did not work for create wire.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a crash if in partial select mode with dynamic highlite on and highliting a via instance.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Added capability to set overbar/underbars to labels.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed an issue where instance name clashes occurred. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.25 release on 17/12/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: short tracer now handles polygon shapes for checking extracted view connectivity.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: add vertex command would remove colinear vertices, and shouldn't.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a potential crash writing CDL if inst masters had unbound net info.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Setting pan/zoom options did not update to xml on exit.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.6.26 release on 24/12/2017</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Several EDIF export bugs fixed.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: XML preferences were only read from local directory if a preference file was found in the user's home directory. Now, both are checked, and the local settings (if present) are merged into the global ones.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a potential crash when deleting a cellView. Could occur e.g. when importing GDS2 with duplicate cells.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Creating a MPP with 2 points failed.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Fixed a bug where the Pan/Zoom options were not getting saved back to the preferences file.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: spice format instnames option was not saved to preferences file</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Create Instance dialog did not set inst name prefix according to device type in schematics if spice format names was set.</p>
