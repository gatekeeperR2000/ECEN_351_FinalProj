      <h2> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <b>Editing Commands</b> </font></h2>

      <p>
        Note that there are several function keys that can be used 
        during viewing and editing. F1-F9 are hard coded and cannot be reassigned like 
        bindkeys. On some platforms e.g. Mac, the function keys by default are assigned 
        to special actions by the OS (for example raising/lowering the brightness of the 
        display). It is possible to switch to normal Fn key mode 
        operation (e.g. on the Mac by the Settings-&gt;Keyboard dialog).
      </p>

      <p> 
        <b>Escape key</b> <a name="edit_escape"></a>
        - aborts the current command.
      </p>

      <p> 
        <b>Return key</b> <a name="edit_return"></a>
        - completes a Create Path, Create Polygon, Create MPP, Create Wire or Reshape command. The current cursor position 
        is used as the last point. This is usuallly easier than double clicking to complete these commands.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Backspace key</b> <a name="edit_backspace"></a> 
        - deletes the last vertex during a Create Path, Create Polygon, Create MPP, Create Wire or Reshape command.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>F1 key</b> <a name="edit_F1"></a>
        - opens the help browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>F2 key</b> <a name="edit_F2"></a>
        - toggles the <a href="view_menu.htm" target="selection_options">Selection Options</a> 'Gravity Mode' on/off.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>F3 key</b> <a name="edit_F3"></a>
        - shows/hides the&nbsp;command option dialogs.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>F4 key</b>  <a name="edit_F4"></a>
        - toggles the<a href="view_menu.htm" target="selection_options"> Selection Options</a> 
        Full and Partial selection modes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>F5 key</b> <a name="edit_F5"></a> 
        - shows the Enter Coordinate dialog. For any command that normally takes 
        a mouse click to enter a coordinate, F5 allows the user to specify the coordinates 
        through the Enter Coordinates dialog box instead. For example, if you want 
        to create a rectangle with coordinates (0.0, 0.0) (2.0, 3.0), click on the 
        Create Rectangle icon, then press F5 and enter the first pair of coordinates 
        and press OK. Then press F5 again and enter the second pair of coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>F6 key</b> </strong><a name="edit_F6"></a> 
        - toggles the <a href="view_menu.htm" target="selection_options">Selection Options</a> 
        'Display Connectivity' mode on/off.
      </p>

      <p>

        <b>F9 key</b> <a name="edit_F9"></a>
        - cycles through the Snap Mode angle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also note that double clicking the left mouse button will add a final path/mpp point, 
        or add a final polygon point, or terminate the Reshape command.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distance to nudge by is set according to the <em>Nudge By</em> choice.<em> User deltaX/Y</em> 
        takes the values of <em>X delta</em> and<em> Y delta</em> as the nudge distance. <em>Snap Grid</em> 
        sets the nudge distance to the current X and Y snap distances. <em>Minor Grid</em> sets the nudge 
        distnance to the current X and Y display grid. <em>Major Grid</em> sets the nudge distance to the 
        minor display grid times the major grid multiplier.
      </p>

      <p>
        After invoking the command, the left/right/up/down arrow keys moce the selected set according to 
        the nudge distance, until the command is aborted by pressing the ESC key. While the nudge command 
        is active, zooming, selecting/deselecting etc is available - but not panning via the arrow keys.

        If <i>Lock diagonals</i> is checked, diagonal edges will be locked to 45 degrees. 
        Otherwise moving an edge adjacent to a diagonal may make the diagonal edge 
        become any angle. If <em>Lock endpoints</em> is checked, then stretching a path  segment at 
        the beginning or end of the path will split the path at the start or end vertex, keeping the 
        start/end vertex fixed and stretching the other part of the split segment.
      </p>

      <p> 
        If infix mode is on, the current cursor position is 
        used for the reference coordinate. Else you will be prompted to enter the reference coordinate. 
        During a stretch operation, the object edge(s)/vertex(vertices) are shown as outlines and delta

      <p>
        Reshapes the currently selected 
        edge of a polygon or path. First select an edge of a polygon or the centreline 
        of a path (in edge selection mode). Then enter vertices you wish to add to 
        the edge. The original start and end points of the edge remain the same, vertices 
        can be added with diagonal, manhattan or any angle snapping. Double click 
        or press return to complete reshaping the edge. Pressing backspace will back 
        up one vertex. Although Reshape only works with paths and polygons, you can convert 
        any object e.g. a rectangle to a polygon using the Edit-&gt;Convert to Polygon 
        command.
      </p>

      <h4><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Round Corners<a name="edit_round"></a>
      </font> </h4>

      <p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/round.png"> </p>
      <p>
        Rounds the corners 
        of a rectangle or polygons. You must first select a shape to round. 
        <em>Corner radius</em> sets the radius of curvature in microns. <em>Number of 
        segments per corner</em> sets the precision of the generated curve which is made 
        up of segments (straight lines). <em>Snap Grid</em> sets the manufacturing snap 
        grid to avoid off-grid vertices; if no snapping is required set the value to the 
        user database resolution (usually 0.001um). If <em>Delete original shape</em> is 
        checked (the default), the original shape is deleted, else it is 
        kept.
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Add Vertex<a name="edit_add_vertex"></a>
      </font> </h4>

      <p> 
        Adds a vertex to a selected path or polygon at the point given by 
        the cursor. The vertex that has been added is selected so it can be moved 
        using a Stretch command.
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Rotate<a name="edit_rotate"></a>
      </font></h4>

      <h4 align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/rotate.png"> </h4>

      <p>
        Rotates the current selected set 
        about a point, which the user is prompted to enter. <i>Mirror about Xaxis</i> 
        mirrors the objects in X, <i>Mirror about Y axis</i> mirrors the objects in 
        Y. <i>Rotate CCW</i> rotates the objects counterclockwise. Rotate (instances 
        and shapes) rotates instances according to the transform selected. Rotate by 
        angle rotates shapes by any angle from -360.0 to +360.0 degrees; a positive angle 
        corresponds to a clockwise rotation. Only shapes can be rotated by any angle; 
        rectangles and squares get converted to polygons and are then rotated, while paths 
        and polygons are maintained and their vertices are rotated. Note: cell placement 
        orientation can be changed by querying the instance's properties and changing the 
        orientation.
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Move Origin<a name="edit_move_origin"></a>
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Moves the origin of the current cell. Click on the point that you want to make the 
        new origin, and all object coordinates in the current cell will be changed to make 
        this point (0, 0).
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edit-&gt;Convert to Polygon<a name="edit_path_to_polygon"></a></font></h4>

      <p>
        Converts selected shapes into polygons. Useful in conjunction with the Edit-&gt;Reshape command above.
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Boolean Operations...<a name="booleans"></a>
      </font></h4>

      <p>
        Perform boolean operations on layers.
      </p>

      <p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/boolean.png"> </p>

      <p>
        <i>Layer1</i> and <i>Layer2</i> are input layers, and <i>Output Layer</i> is the 
        output layer. By default layer data is processed from the current open cellView, 
        however it is possible to set the lib/cell/view names of the cells containing 
        <em>Layer1</em> data and <em>Layer2</em> data.Operations that can be performed are 
        two layer AND, two layer OR, single layer OR (merge), single layer NOT, two layer NOT, 
        two layer XOR, sizing and up/down sizing (first size up by a given amount, then 
        size down by the same amount - useful for removing small gaps or notches) and 
        selection (select all shapes on a layer that touch shapes on another layer). 
        <em>Mode</em> allows either selected shapes on <em>Layer1</em> and, if 
        used, <em>Layer2</em> to be processed only, else all shapes for the layer(s) will 
        be processed. If <i>Output data as trapezoids</i> is checked, the resulting layer is 
        converted into trapezoids rather than complex polygons. If <i>Hierarchical</i> is 
        checked, the design hierarchy is flattened and all shapes on the layer(s) are processed; 
        else just shapes in the top level cellview are processed. The <i>Output Cellview</i> 
        is the destination for the generated data. By default this is set to the current cellview, but can 
        be any cellview; if the cellview does not exist it will be created.        
        If <i>Size Output Layer</i> is checked, the output layer can be also sized by an amount 
        (except for the operation <em>Size lyr1</em>).
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Tiled Boolean Operations...<a name="tiled_booleans"></a> 
      </font> </h4>

      <p>
        Performs boolean operations on layers. Useful when the data is too large to 
        process with Edit-&gt;Boolean Operations... as it uses a tiling algorithm to 
        process the data tile by tile.
      </p>

      <p align="center"> <img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/tiledBoolean.png"> </p>

      <p> 
        <em>Layer1</em> data and <em>Layer2 data</em> specify 
        the input layer sources. The cellView for each layer defaults to the current 
        displayed cellView, but can be changed e.g. to compare two cells using an 
        XOR operation on the same layer, for example. <em>Operation</em> specifies the boolean 
        operation to be performed. Currently only merge (single layer OR), OR, 
        AND, ANDNOT, NOT, XOR and SIZE operations are supported. The <em>Output Cellview</em> 
        specifies the cellView that output shapes will be created on, according to 
        the <em>output layer</em> specified.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Hierarchical is checked, the cellView's data is flattenned before the operation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Tile size</em> can be determined automatically if 
        <em>Tiling Mode</em> is set to <em>Auto</em>. Else the tile width and height 
        can be specified if <em>Tiling Mode</em> is set to <em>Manual</em>. The larger 
        the tile size, the more physical memory will be used. For large designs with 
        many levels of hierarchy, computing the best tile size can take a long time 
        - so in this case manually setting the tile sizes is preferable. Typically 
        a starting point of 500-1000um should be acceptable. Seting smaller tile sizes 
        will use less memory, but may run longer.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Multithreaded</em>      
        specifies that the tiles are split and run on a multiple number of threads, 
        which may speed up overall runtime at the expense of somewhat more memory 
        usage. # threads defaults to the maximum number of threads that are feasible 
        on your system. For example, a 4 core Intel i7 processor will support 8 threads. 
        Speed improvement is not linear with the number of threads due to IO and memory 
        bottlenecks. Typically with 4 cores, about 3.5x speed improvement is gained. 
      </p>

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Merge Selected<a name="edit_merge"></a>
      </font> </h4>

      <p>
        Merges all selected shapes into polygons. Layers are 
        preserved, i.e. only shapes on the same layer are merged. If you want 
        to merge shapes on different layers, use the Edit-&gt;Booleans command with operation Layer1 OR layer2.

        Chops a rectangle out of a selected 
        shape. First, select a shape. Then invoke the chop command and draw a chop 
        rectangle. The shape will have the rectangle chopped out of it. If <i>Convert 
        paths to polygons</i> is checked, paths will be converted to polygons before 
        the chop takes place. Otherwise paths will be maintained and will be cut. 
        If <i>Keep chopped shapes</i> is checked, the chop shapes from polygons are 
        not deleted.

        e.g. by their left edges, and <i>Vertical</i> will align them vertically e.g. 
        by their bottom edges.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        <em>Align Using</em> can be by <i>Object Origin</i>, <i>Object bBox</i> or <i>Layer bBox</i>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li> 
          <i>Object Origin</i> aligns according to the origin of an instance or array 
          or the lower left of the bounding box of shapes.
        <li> 
          <i>Object bBox</i> aligns 
          according to the two object's bounding boxes, and ignores the <i>Alignment 
          Direction</i>. When selected, <i>Object bBox </i>alignment will enable the 
          <i>Alignment Reference</i> choices over which edge of the bounding box will 
          be aligned. For example selecting <i>Top</i> will align the top edges of 
          the objects; <i>Centre</i> will align the objects so they are centred on 
          each other.
        <li> 
          <i>Layer bBox </i>alignment 
          is only applicable when aligning instances, and will align them according 
          to a common layer in the instance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <i>Spacing Type</i> 
        sets whether the objects should be spaced apart as they are aligned. It can 
        be set to either <i>None</i>, <i>Space</i> or <i>Pitch</i>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <i>None</i> does not space objects when aligning them. For example if objects are aligned according to their 
          origin horizontally, their position in the Y direction remains unchanged.
        <li> 
          <i>Space</i> aligns objects 
          so that the space between the reference object edge and the first object edge, the 
          first object edge and the second object edge and so on is equal to the space value 
          set. For Object bBox / Layer bBox alignment, spacing is only valid for left/right/top/bottom alignment reference.
        <li> 
          <i>Pitch</i> aligns objects 
          so that the pitch between the reference object and the first object, the 
          first object and the second object and so on is equal to the pitch value 
          set. For Object bBox / Layer bBox alignment, pitch is only valid for left/right/top/bottom alignment reference.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Click on <i>Set Reference 
        Object to align to</i> to set the alignment reference object. Then click on 
        the objects you wish to align; cancel or OK the dialog to finish an alignment 
        sequence, or click again on <i>Set Reference Object</i> to start a new alignment. 
        Note: cancel or OK the Align command before carrying out another command.

      <p>
        <em>Bias</em> can be either <em>Bias by Layer</em>, which biases all  shapes on the specified 
        <em>Layer to bias</em>,  or <em>Bias Selected</em> (selected shapes can  be on any layer). 
        <em>Bias by</em> sets the  bias. A positive bias causes shapes to grow in size; a negative bias 
        causes  them to shrink. If <em>Bias all cells?</em> is checked, all cells in the library will 
        have the bias applied. Coordinates are  snapped to the <em>X Snap Grid</em> and <em>Y Snap Grid</em>. 
        Note that polygons with collinear  or coincident points will not be biased correctly and a

      <p align="center"><img src="images/find1.png" width="624" height="579" alt="Find"></p>

      <p>
        Find searches for objects, either in the current cellView, or hierarchically from the current 
        cellView down, and optionally can replace them, or their attributes and/or properties. Names 
        can be matched by <em>Wildcards</em> (e.g. VDD* matches VDD1, VDD2,  VDD) or by <em>RegExp</em> 
        (regular  expressions). Currently you can search for instances, nets, shapes, ellipses/circles, 
        labels, MPPs, paths, polygons, rectangles and viaInsts.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each object type you can add a criteria. For example instances can have cell name, lib name, 
        inst name, view name, orientation and properties as the criteria to match them. You can have one
        or more criteria, and match All criteria (i.e. the AND of each) or Any criteria (i.e. the OR of each).
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects that match the search criteria can be added to the  selected set or highlighted according to 
        the <em>Find Action</em>. If <em>Find Action</em> is <em>Select</em>, objects will be selected, 
        and further control is given by <em>Select Action</em>. <em>New Selection</em> clears any existing 
        selected objects. <em>Add to Selection</em> adds the found selected ites to the selected set. 
        <em>Remove from Selection</em> removes found objects from the selected set. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of highlighted nets, they can be displayed  either as the actual net shapes highlighted if 
        <em>Highlight Shapes</em> is checked, or by a <em>Spanning Tree</em> between the instance pins of 
        the instances the net  connects to, or as <em>a Steiner tree</em>.  This is useful, for example, in 
        highlighting the connectivity of unrouted nets;  the spanning tree is a good approximation to the path 
        an autorouter will take;  the Steiner tree is even better although can be slow on nets with many pins.  
        The highlight colour can be chosen using the <em>Highlight  Colour</em> button; the <em>Highlight Fill</em> 
        can be <em>Solid</em> or <em>Hollow</em> and the linewidth can be specified for hollow fills. Optionally 
        the display can <em>Zoom to Selected</em> object(s) and it is possible to clear all highlighted  objects 
        using the <em>Clear highlighted</em> button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once objects have been found (by clicking on the Find button), then it is possible to replace them. The 
        <em>Replace</em> combo box shows the possible replacements depending on the object searched for. For 
        example you can replace the layer of a shape, or the property of an object.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that it is not currently possible to undo the actions of the <em>Replace</em> command. Be sure 
        to save first!

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Edit-&gt;Query<a name="query_object"></a></font></h4>

      <p>

        the left mouse button.
      </p>

      <p align="center"><img border="0" hspace="0" src="images/query_rect.png"></p>

    <p>
      With nothing selected, the current cell's properties are queried. Otherwise you may query any 
      selected object's properties and attributes, and cycle through the selected set using the <i>Previous</i> 
      and <i>Next</i> buttons. You can delete a queried object using the <i>Delete</i> button. You can 
      remove an&nbsp;object from the selected set with the <em>Deselect </em> button. &nbsp;If multiple 
      objects are selected, <i>Change all selected objects </i>allows their common attributes to be changed. 
      For example, if shapes are selected then the layer may be changed for all shapes. If the object 
      has connectivity, a Net properties tab is added to the dialog. All objects may have user or 
      system-defined properties which can be manipulated on the Properties tab page.
    </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/properties.png" width="691" height="435" alt="Properties"></p>

      <p>
        Properties can be added as string, float, integer, boolean, list or orient. Click on the property 
        name or value to change the text, or click on the type and select the type in the combo box that will 
        appear. Click on the '+' button to add a (initially blank) property entry, or select a property 
        and click on the '-' button to delete the property. There is currently no undo capability if you delete 
        a property!

      <h4> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        Edit-&gt;Bindkeys</font> <a name="edit_bindkeys"></a>
      </h4>

      <p>
        All menus and toolbar buttons have actions. An action has a unique command associated with it; it also has 
        an optional bindkey. For example the 'Open Cell' action by default has a bindkey Ctrl+O.
      </p>

      <p> 
        Bindkeys may be redefined by the 
          user using the Edit Bindkeys command. This shows a table of all current bindkey 
          assignments. 
      </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="images/bindkeys.png" width="301" height="539" alt="Bindkeys"></p>

      <p>
        Clicking on the 'Bindkey' 
        entry in the table allows editing the bindkey for that action. A single letter 
        in uppercase indicates that key will be used. Modifier keys may be specified 
        e.g. Shift+, Ctrl+, Alt+ and should precede the key, with no spaces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bindkeys are saved in the preferences file (~/.gladerc) and are loaded automatically every time 
        Glade is run. A local .gladerc file will override values specified in the global ~/.gladerc 
        file, so you have a project-specific subset of settings.
