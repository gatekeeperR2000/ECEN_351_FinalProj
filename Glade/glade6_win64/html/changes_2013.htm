width of an existing selected path, h/vseg or the minimum of the width or height 
of a rectangle.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: the create path dialog has a 
'Keep width const' checkbox; selecting this before changing layer (using the 'u' 
or 'd' bindkeys) will keep the path width the same, rather than revert to the 
techfile minWidth for the layer.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.45 
release on 20/06/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: implemented 'geomMargin()' DRC 
check. This checks the spacing from the vertex of a pair of concave edges of a 
polygon to an adjacent 'contained' rectangle's nearest vertex. The 
(non-manhattan) distance is required to be larger than the square root of the 
minimum spacing rule between the shapes due to lithography effects (e.g. ink

restructured and made possible boolean ops between shapes on different 
cellViews.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Query MPP properties did not allow 
the vertices of the MPP to be edited; this is now fixed.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Glade will read a local 
.gladerc in the current directory if present after reading the $HOME/.gladerc. 
It will always write preferences to the $HOME/.gladerc only.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: MPP shapes were being ignored by 
geomGetShapes for e.g. DRC. Bugs in DRC handling of MPPs fixed.</p>

<p align="left">- bugfix: Import LEF not recognising .gz 
files.</p>

segments could give DRCs or missing contacts.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export GDS did not export MPPs</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: In partial selection mode, it was 
possible to select the outline of a path. Now only the centreline can be 
selected. However, gravity still can be set to path outlines or centrelines.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: in non-OpenGL mode, MPPs were not 
being drawn correctly.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: extractDevice() cmd updated to 
use pcells like other extract... commands.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.48 
release on 10/07/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: via instances now correctly handled 
by geom... processing e.g. during extraction.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Edit-&gt;Convert to Polygon can 
now convert vias to polygons.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: CDL export ignores model name option 
when writing parasitic capacitances</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: extractParasitic3(lowerLayer, 
upperLayer, areaCap, perimCap, [layer1,layer2...]) only extracts capacitance 
between lowerLayer and upperLayer if shield layer(s) layer1... layerN are not 
present between them. Note no checkinig is done for valid layers (yet).</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Importing a techfile now 
deletes any existing MPP definitions in a library.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: exporting a techfile writes correct 
MPP syntax.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Using the middle mouse drag during 
e.g. a move command to pan as you move now works as expected.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.49 
release on 12/07/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: false DRC errors when using MPPs 
fixed.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: export CDL can now filter small 
parasitic C's.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.50 
release on 04/08/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: geomLabel(), geomSetText() handle 
'holes' correctly now.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: geomConnect() rewritten to handle 
holes in connect layers correctly.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Trace Net broke in 4.3.49, fixed in 
4.3.50.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Export CDL&nbsp;can lump small 
parasitics on the same net together into a single parasitic.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.51 
release on 19/08/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Alpha blending was never working on 
the non-OpenGL version of Glade; it was not properly supported in Qt 3.x, and in 
Qt 4.x there is a problem if you store colours as QRgb values rather than as 
QColours. This has been fixed, so the full power of alpha blending can be used 
on non-OpenGL use. As a result, the 'Opacity' toolbar has been removed, as its 
purpose is less than useful if you can set transparency by layer. Try changing 
some of your layers e.g. poly and metal1 to have an alpha value of 128, and set 
their fill patterns to be solid. </p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.52 
release on 02/09/2013</strong></p>

release on 08/09/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: Export CDL bugs fixed.</p>
<p align="left">- enhancement: Gemini LVS now allows 
permutability of resistor &amp; capacitor terminals. Allows inductors. Does not 
crash when merging parallel transistors without the -w option. Handles M factor 
in CDL netlist.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Version 4.3.54 
release on 27/09/2013</strong></p>

paths</p>

release on 18/10/2013</strong></p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: extraction of TFT devices improved 
to handle multiple device topologies.</p>
<p align="left">- bugfix: ruler in OpenGL mode was being drawn 
with a linewidth &gt; 1 </p>
